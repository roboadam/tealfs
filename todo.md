- [x] Robust block fetching - goes to backup on failure
- [x] Everywhere blocks - for file index
- [x] UI setup
- [x] Break up big blocks
- [ ] Rebalance on disk changes
    - [x] Calculate primary node
    - [ ] Collect all on-disk block ids from other nodes on primary
        - [x] On primary node send AllBlockIdReq to other nodes
        - [ ] All nodes respond to AllBlockIdReq with AllBlockIdResp
        - [ ] Once all nodes have responded kick off next step
    - [ ] Emit all block Id pointers from filesystem on primary node
    - [ ] Delete all block Ids that don't have a pointer
    - [ ] Find real disk location of each block id pointer
    - [ ] Perform necessary moves
- [ ] Update Readme
- [ ] Check for race conditions in tests
- [ ] Hash as filename
- [ ] Delete unused blocks
- [ ] Automatically choose ports
- [ ] Encryption in transit
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Combine small blocks
- [ ] UI Refresh
- [ ] XOR background process
