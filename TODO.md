- [x] Robust block fetching - goes to backup on failure
- [x] Everywhere blocks - for file index
- [x] UI setup
- [x] Break up big blocks
- [ ] Rebalance on disk changes
    - [x] Revert the code I already wrote
    - [ ] Global BlockID list
        - [x] Use an mgr level broadcast to maintain list
            - [x] Struct to hold broadcast and serialize/deserialize it
            - [x] Send the broadcast when adding a BlockId
            - [x] Receive the broadcast and update a list
        - [x] Save that list to disk on update
        - [x] Load that list on startup
        - [ ] Periodically pick one node to update all other mgrs with a broadcast
    - [ ] In the event of a disk change (resize/removal/addition)
        - [ ] Pick one node's mgr to do the updating
        - [ ] Loop through all BlockIDs
            - [ ] Get a list of disks that have that block but don't need it
            - [ ] Fetch the data if that list isn't empty
            - [ ] For each of those disks send the data
            - [ ] For each disk that doesn't need the data delete it
- [ ] Update Readme
